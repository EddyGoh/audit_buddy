      "1. **What is the PSEA?**\n",
      "   The Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) is a financial scheme established to assist Singapore Citizens in funding their post-secondary education. It is automatically opened for all eligible citizens and is managed by the Ministry of Education (MOE).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Eligibility and Account Opening:**\n",
      "   - The PSEA is opened for individuals who have a balance in either their Child Development Account (CDA) upon turning 13 or their Edusave Account upon turning 17 or when they cease to study in an MOE-funded school.\n",
      "   - The account can also be opened for those eligible for government top-ups or awards.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Usage of Funds:**\n",
      "   - PSEA funds can be utilized to pay for approved educational programs at designated institutions, repay government education loans, and financial schemes.\n",
      "   - The balance in the PSEA earns interest pegged to the CPF Ordinary Account (currently at 2.5% per annum).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Account Notifications:**\n",
      "   Account holders receive notifications through the Singpass app or SMS regarding their account status, including monthly transaction statements and annual summaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Account Closure:**\n",
      "   - The PSEA will be closed approximately in the middle of the year the account holder turns 31. Prior to closure, account holders will be notified and can choose to transfer their balance or donate it to the Education Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Education Endowment and Savings Schemes (Post-secondary Education Scheme) Regulations:**\n",
      "   - The contributions to the PSEA by a parent are capped based on the member’s birth order and the timing of citizenship.\n",
      "   - There are specified conditions for withdrawals from the PSEA and provisions for transferring funds to and from the account.\n",
